Description: Canopy2 is a statistical and computational method for tumor phylogeny inference using
    single-nucleotide variants derived from bulk DNA and single-cell RNA sequencing. Canopy2 samples 
    from a joint probability distribution involving a mixture of a binomial and beta-binomials, 
    specifically chosen to account for the sparsity and stochasticity of the single-cell data. The 
    input involves variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) 
    present in the bulk DNA whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Canopy2 outputs 
    convergence diagnostics for each evolutionary configuration and uses the deviance information 
    criterion (DIC) to select the optimal evolutionary configuration.
