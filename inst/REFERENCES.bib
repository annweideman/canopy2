  abstract        = {Allele-specific expression is traditionally studied by bulk RNA sequencing, which measures average expression across cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows the comparison of expression distribution between the two alleles of a diploid organism and the characterization of allele-specific bursting. Here, we propose SCALE to analyze genome-wide allele-specific bursting, with adjustment of technical variability. SCALE detects genes exhibiting allelic differences in bursting parameters and genes whose alleles burst non-independently. We apply SCALE to mouse blastocyst and human fibroblast cells and find that cis control in gene expression overwhelmingly manifests as differences in burst frequency.},

  abstract = {Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy number profiles at the cellular level and holds great promise for deciphering tumor heterogeneity. The data are, however, extremely sparse and noisy because of the shallow depth of coverage and the biases and artifacts that are introduced. We propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for the noisy scDNA-seq data. SCOPE's main features include: (i) a Poisson latent factor model for normalization, which borrows information across cells and regions to estimate bias, using in silico identified negative control cells; (ii) an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the normalization step, which accounts for the aberrant copy number changes and allows direct ploidy estimation without the need for post hoc adjustment; and (iii) a cross-sample segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells with the same genetic background. We evaluate SCOPE on a diverse set of scDNA-seq data in cancer genomics and show that SCOPE offers accurate copy number estimates and successfully reconstructs subclonal structure. More than a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic risk variants that are significantly associated with complex traits. Emerging evidence suggests that the function of trait-associated variants likely acts in a tissue- or cell-type specific fashion. Yet, it remains challenging to prioritize trait-relevant tissues or cell types to elucidate disease etiology. Here, we present EPIC (cEll tyPe enrIChment), a statistical framework that relates large-scale GWAS summary statistics to cell-type-specific gene expression measurements from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We derive powerful gene-level test statistics for common and rare variants, separately and jointly, and adopt generalized least squares to prioritize trait-relevant cell types while accounting for the correlation structures both within and between genes. Using enrichment of loci associated with four lipid traits in the liver and enrichment of loci associated with three neurological disorders in the brain as ground truths, we show that EPIC outperforms existing methods. We apply our framework to multiple scRNA-seq datasets from different platforms and identify cell types underlying type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. The enrichment is replicated using independent GWAS and scRNA-seq datasets and further validated using PubMed search and existing bulk case-control testing results. Cancer is a disease driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations, where somatic mutations including point mutations and copy number aberrations occur in tumor progression. Multiple methods have been developed to reconstruct evolutionary history by bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) of longitudinally/spatially separated tumor samples. However, they suffer from low resolution and deconvolution ambiguity. Here we devise a framework to relate bulk genomic profiles to single-cell transcriptomic variations for understanding the functional implications of intratumor heterogeneity. Jointly analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk WES data can boost the power for phylogeny reconstruction. We apply the method to analyze bulk WES and scRNA-seq data from breast cancer and glioblastoma patients.},

  abstract        = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/.},

  abstract        = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology allows detection of gene expression at the single-cell level. One typical feature of the data is a bimodality in the cellular distribution even for highly expressed genes, primarily caused by a proportion of non-expressing cells. The standard and the over-dispersed gamma-Poisson models that are commonly used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing are not able to capture this property. We introduce a beta-Poisson mixture model that can capture the bimodality of the single-cell gene expression distribution. We further integrate the model into the generalized linear model framework in order to perform differential expression analyses. The whole analytical procedure is called BPSC. The results from several real single-cell RNA-seq datasets indicate that ∼90% of the transcripts are well characterized by the beta-Poisson model; the model-fit from BPSC is better than the fit of the standard gamma-Poisson model in > 80% of the transcripts. Moreover, in differential expression analyses of simulated and real datasets, BPSC performs well against edgeR, a conventional method widely used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing data, and against scde and MAST, two recent methods specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. An R package BPSC for model fitting and differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data is available under GPL-3 license at https://github.com/nghiavtr/BPSC CONTACT: yudi.pawitan@ki.se or mattias.rantalainen@ki.se Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract        = {Precision medicine in cancer proposes that genomic characterization of tumors can inform personalized targeted therapies. However, this proposition is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here we study genomic and expression profiles across 127 multisector or longitudinal specimens from 52 individuals with glioblastoma (GBM). Using bulk and single-cell data, we find that samples from the same tumor mass share genomic and expression signatures, whereas geographically separated, multifocal tumors and/or long-term recurrent tumors are seeded from different clones. Chemical screening of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) shows that therapeutic response is associated with genetic similarity, and multifocal tumors that are enriched with PIK3CA mutations have a heterogeneous drug-response pattern. We show that targeting truncal events is more efficacious than targeting private events in reducing the tumor burden. In summary, this work demonstrates that evolutionary inference from integrated genomic analysis in multisector biopsies can inform targeted therapeutic interventions for patients with GBM.},

Inferred copy number variations from the single-cell RNA-seq data separate carcinoma cells from non-cancer cells. At a single-cell resolution, carcinoma cells display common signatures within the tumour as well as intratumoral heterogeneity regarding breast cancer subtype and crucial cancer-related pathways. Most of the non-cancer cells are immune cells, with three distinct clusters of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. T lymphocytes and macrophages both display immunosuppressive characteristics: T cells with a regulatory or an exhausted phenotype and macrophages with an M2 phenotype. These results illustrate that the breast cancer transcriptome has a wide range of intratumoral heterogeneity, which is shaped by the tumour cells and immune cells in the surrounding microenvironment.},
